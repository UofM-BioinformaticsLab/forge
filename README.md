# Welcome to the FORGE: A Framework for Organizing Rewards in Gamified Environments.

## This project contains three folders:

- [FORGE-server](/forge-server): the framework containing the source code for the backend and front-end.
- [FORGE-app](/forge-app): a web application that uses FORGE, created as an example for anyone who wants to learn how to use the framework.
- [FORGE-game](/forge-game): a concept game made in Unity 3D to serve as an example of how to use FORGE in Unity.

Each folder has a README file with instructions on how to install and configure the application.
